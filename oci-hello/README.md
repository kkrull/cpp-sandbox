# OCI Hello World

Use an OCI (a.k.a Docker, podman) container to build C++ for Linux with
[GCC](https://hub.docker.com/_/gcc).

## What compiler?

Ok so I was a little lost since last using g++ about 20 years ago, and I couldn't remember if that
was still a thing.  Apparently it is - it's the C++ front-end for the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC).
This post describes the diffeerence between `gcc` and `g++`:

## Usage

Who has time to remember how to run Docker?  Just use the `Makefile`!
