# Hello World with CMake

## How does cmake fit in?

I started out thinking that `cmake` is the thing I often have to use when building packages from

I'm going to have to learn for doing my own C++ development.

This StackOverflow answer was helpful for figuring out how `autotools` (the way I'm used to seeing)
relates to `cmake` and other tools:
